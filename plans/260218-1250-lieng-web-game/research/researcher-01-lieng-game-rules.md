## 1. CARD VALUES & POINT SYSTEM

### Card Values

### Point Calculation (Modulo 10)

- Example: 3-4-5, J-Q-K, A-2-3

## 5. TIEBREAKER RULES

### Same Points (Normal Hands)
When 2+ players have identical point totals, use **suit hierarchy of highest card:**

**♦ Diamond > ♥ Heart > ♣ Club > ♠ Spade**

### Examples
- {♠A, ♣7, ♦2} vs {♥3, ♣4, ♠3} — both 0 points, first wins (has ♦)
- {♦A, ♣3, ♥6} vs {♠2, ♣2, ♦6} — both 0 points, first wins (♦A > ♦6)

### Special Hand Ties
- **Same Sáp:** Compare card rank (A-A-A > K-K-K)
- **Same Liêng:** Compare high card (Q-K-A > 10-J-Q)
- **Same Ảnh:** Use suit tiebreaker on highest card

## UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS

1. **Sáp ranking ambiguity:** Some sources treat Sáp as highest, others say "special combos beat points but unclear if Sáp > Liêng or vice versa"
2. **Side pot mechanics:** No explicit rules found for multi-player all-in scenarios with unequal stacks
3. **Raise caps:** No standardized maximum raise limit documented
4. **Dealer advantage:** Does dealer act last in betting? Research unclear on turn order
5. **Minimum players for variants:** Cào Cái requires how many players minimum besides dealer?
6. **Tie with Ảnh hands:** If both have 3 face cards (e.g., J-Q-K vs K-K-Q), is suit tiebreaker used or specific combo ranking?
